% These are modifications to the behaviour of \cite and \shortcite
% for the natbib.sty style to allow them to be used the way I like
% i.e. 
% \cite does a full citation in parentheses, but leaves a space first
% \shortcite gives the year only, in parentheses.
% These allow an easy switch to a 'power' style of citation without
% having to remove spaces
