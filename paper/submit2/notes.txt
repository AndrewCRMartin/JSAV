MODexplorer: an integrated tool for exploring protein sequence,
structure and function relationships. kosinski:2013

Sequence alignment visualization in HTML5 without Java.   gille:2014 / gille:2014aa
Part of STRAP - Strap is JAVA but enables alignments to be generated in pure HTML
Licenced under GPL but the JavaScript visualizer doesn't apperar to be
available by itself. Controlled by a
'Strap' scripting language. 
http://www.bioinformatics.org/strap/aa/
Quoting from the documents on the web:
"Prepare your alignment in Strap or the webservice Alignment
Annotator. Load your sequences, add your annotations, balloon
messages, icons and 3D-structures. "
Link on "Batch mode - preparing alignment views non-interactively:" is
broken


SnipViz: a compact and lightweight web site widget for display and
dissemination of multiple versions of gene and protein sequences. jaschob:2014
http://www.yeastrc.org/snipviz/
Very simple display, none of the options we require. Does support DNA
and Newick files for displaying trees. Scrollable display for long DNA sequences.

Sequence, a BioJS component for visualizing sequences. gomez:2014
Overhead of BioJS
Only very simple views though flexible highlighting



Need to point out highlighting ability

Has been tested with Firefox 9.0.1 - V32.0, recent versions of Chrome
