   abstract = "The alignment of homologous sequences with each other and their display has proved a difficult task, despite a frequent requirement for this process. HOMED enables related sequences to be edited and listed in parallel with each other. The editor function uses a full screen editor which emulates the text editors KED and EDT (on PDP-11 and VAX-11 respectively) and which can be adapted to emulate other text editors. This emulation has been adopted to simplify user learning of editing functions. HOMED provides functions for listing the sequences in a variety of formats and for generating a consensus sequence as well as providing a series of tools for maintenance of the sequence database. HOMED has been implemented in Pascal in a modular fashion to enhance portability."

The quality of the alignment can be easily judged during its development because the display attributes to each character are determined by the way it matches the other sequences. Four methods are available for calculating the highlighting to emphasize different aspects of the relationships of the sequences and up to four styles of highlighting can be used at the same time. Laser printer output is suitable for publication without modification."

The PHYLO\_WIN program allows phylogenetic tree building according to most usual methods (neighbor joining with numerous distance estimates, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood), and a bootstrap analysis with any of them. Reconstructed trees can be drawn, edited, printed, stored, evaluated according to numerous criteria. Taxonomic species groups and sets of conserved regions can be defined by mouse and stored into sequence files, thus avoiding multiple data files. Both tools are entirely mouse driven. On-line help makes them easy to use.

It deviates more from classical text editors than other available sequence editors because it uses a different approach towards editing. It shifts characters or entire blocks of aligned characters, rather than inserting or deleting gaps in the sequences. Alignment of a new sequence to an existing alignment is partly automated. Although DCSE can be used on protein sequence alignments, it is especially targeted at the examination of RNA. The secondary structure for every sequence can be incorporated easily in the alignment. DCSE also has extensive built-in support for finding and checking secondary structure elements. A sophisticated system of markers allows notation of special positions in an alignment. This system can be used to store information such as the position of hidden breaks, introns and tertiary structure interactions."

The implementation is highly flexible, so the applet can be easily customised with additional functions; and the object classes are reusable, promoting rapid development of program extensions. Formerly, such extended functionality might have been provided via browser plug-ins, which have to be downloaded and installed on every client before loading data. Now, for the first time, an applet is available that allows interactive client-side processing of an alignment, which can then be stored or processed automatically on the server. The program is embedded in a comprehensive help file and is accessible both as a stand-alone tool on UCL's Bioinformatics Server; http:/(/)www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser+ ++/CINEMA2.02/, and as an integral part of the PRINTS protein fingerprint database. Exploitation of such novel technologies revolutionises the way users may interact with public databases in the future: bioinformatics centres need not simply provide data, but are now able to offer the means by which information is visualised and manipulated, without the requirement for users to install software."

Pull-down menus provide all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment. New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned, and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences.

The contemporary toolkit available for this purpose consists of an ad hoc collection of data manipulation tools, scripting languages and visualization systems; these must often be combined in complex and bespoke ways, the result frequently being an unwieldy artefact capable of one specific task, which cannot easily be exploited or extended by other practitioners. Owing to the sizes of current databases and the scale of the analyses necessary, routine bioinformatics tasks are often automated, but many still require the unique experience and intuition of human researchers: this requires tools that support real-time interaction with complex datasets. Many existing tools have poor user interfaces and limited real-time performance when applied to realistically large datasets; much of the user's cognitive capacity is therefore focused on controlling the tool rather than on performing the research. The UTOPIA project is addressing some of these issues by building reusable software components that can be combined to make useful applications in the field of bioinformatics. Expertise in the fields of human computer interaction, high-performance rendering, and distributed systems is being guided by bioinformaticians and end-user biologists to create a toolkit that is both architecturally sound from a computing point of view, and directly addresses end-user and application-developer requirements."

The annotations include sequence conservation, similarity scores, ligand-, DNA- and RNA-binding sites, secondary structure, disorder, crystallographic structure resolution and quality scores of models implied by the alignments to the homologs of known structure. MODexplorer can be used to analyze sequence and structural conservation among the structures of similar proteins, to find structures of homologs solved in different conformational state or with different ligands and to transfer functional annotations. Furthermore, if the structure of the query is not known, MODexplorer can be used to select the modeling templates taking all this information into account and to build a comparative model."

The alignment is initially displayed using default settings and can be modified with the graphical user interfaces. For example, individual sequences can be reordered or deleted using drag and drop, amino acid color code schemes can be applied and annotations can be added. Annotations can be made manually or imported (BioDAS servers, the UniProt, the Catalytic Site Atlas and the PDB). Some edits take immediate effect while others require server interaction and may take a few seconds to execute. The final alignment document can be downloaded as a zip-archive containing the HTML files. Because of the use of HTML the resulting interactive alignment can be viewed on any platform including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS in any standard web browser. Importantly, no plugins nor Java are required and therefore Alignment-Anotator represents the first interactive browser-based alignment visualization."

Often this is accomplished by displaying all versions of the sequence at once in a manner that is not intuitive or space-efficient and does not facilitate human understanding of the data.

This component aims to facilitate a common representation across different sites, making it easier for end users to move from one site to another."
